# Active Context for Top Tools Project

## Current Work Focus

- **Memory Bank Update**: Conducting comprehensive review and update of all memory bank files to ensure alignment with
  current project status and continuous improvement protocol.
- **Tool Documentation Review**: Validating that all `src/` directory documentation accurately reflects current tool
  recommendations and configurations.
- **Context Management**: Monitoring context window usage during memory bank updates to maintain efficient task
  execution.

## Recent Changes

- Updated memory bank files (`progress.md`, `raw_reflection_log.md`, `activeContext.md`) on 8/2/2025 to reflect recent
  maintenance.
- Updated `progress.md` on 7/9/2025 to document recent developments and new tool additions.
- Added new entry to `raw_reflection_log.md` on 7/9/2025 capturing insights from memory bank maintenance.
- Modified logging setup in `xkcd_scraper.py` on 7/1/2025 to avoid writing logs to a file, ensuring cleaner project
  directory structure.
- Updated `consolidated_learnings.md` on 7/8/2025 to consolidate recent reflections.
- Updated `projectbrief.md` on 8/31/2025 with current timeline and project status.
- Updated `progress.md` on 8/31/2025 to document memory bank update and next review schedule.

## Next Steps

- **Priority**: Complete memory bank update process by documenting this update in `raw_reflection_log.md`.
- **Secondary**: Prepare for community engagement initiative by drafting contribution guidelines.
- **Maintenance**: Conduct scheduled memory bank review on September 1, 2025.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decision to implement quarterly memory bank maintenance cycles to ensure documentation freshness.
- Decision to prioritize tool curation over XKCD Scraper enhancements for immediate roadmap.
- Decision to maintain context window usage below 30% during active development phases.
- Decision to enhance memory bank tracking to focus on src directory changes rather than internal maintenance
  activities.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- User preference for Markdown documentation consistency across all project files.
- Adherence to Baby Steps™ methodology for all maintenance tasks.
- Preference for concise, actionable documentation over verbose explanations.
- Emphasis on maintaining accurate cross-file synchronization between memory bank documents.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The memory bank's primary role is to track changes in the `src/` directory (tool documentation) rather than internal
  maintenance activities.
- Regular memory bank audits significantly improve context preservation across sessions.
- Auto-formatting behavior in VSCode requires special consideration during SEARCH/REPLACE operations.
- Cross-file synchronization (progress.md ↔ activeContext.md) is essential for documentation consistency.
- Maintaining context window usage below 30% improves task execution efficiency.
- Comprehensive memory bank reviews help identify documentation gaps and areas for improvement.
