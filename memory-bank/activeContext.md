# Active Context for Top Tools Project

## Current Work Focus

- **Memory Bank Update**: Updating the memory bank files to reflect the latest project status, prioritizing Top Tools as
  the main focus, with XKCD Scraper as a humorous add-on.
- **Context Window Management**: Addressing high context window usage (previously at 68%) by initiating a task handoff
  to prevent potential context loss, as per `new-task-workflow.md` guidelines.

## Recent Changes

- Modified logging setup in `xkcd_scraper.py` on 7/1/2025 to avoid writing logs to a file, ensuring cleaner project
  directory structure as per user request.
- Updated `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` on 7/2/2025 to shift focus to Top Tools, aligning documentation with user
  clarification.
- Updated `raw_reflection_log.md` on 7/2/2025 with new reflections on project focus and context window management.

## Next Steps

- Complete updates to other memory bank files if necessary to ensure consistency across documentation regarding the Top
  Tools project focus.
- Monitor context window usage in the new task to prevent exceeding critical thresholds, proposing further handoffs if
  necessary.
- Address any additional user requests or adjustments for the Top Tools project or the XKCD Scraper add-on.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decision to retain console logging for debugging purposes in XKCD Scraper while disabling file logging to meet user
  preference for minimal file creation.
- Decision to update memory bank files to prioritize Top Tools as the primary project, with XKCD Scraper as a secondary
  component.
- Decision to create a new task due to high context window usage, ensuring effective context management.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- User preference for minimal file creation outside of essential project outputs (e.g., comic images for XKCD Scraper).
- Adherence to context window management guidelines by initiating task handoffs when usage exceeds 50%.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Simple configuration changes in logging can significantly align tools with user needs regarding project cleanliness.
- Proactive task handoff is essential for managing high context window usage, maintaining project continuity and
  preventing information loss.
- Clear documentation updates are crucial when refocusing project priorities, ensuring all memory bank files reflect the
  correct project scope.
