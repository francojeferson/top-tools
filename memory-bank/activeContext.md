# Active Context for XKCD Scraper Project

## Current Work Focus

- **XKCD Scraper Script Modification**: Updated the `xkcd_scraper.py` script to prevent the creation of the log file
  "xkcd_scraper.log" by removing the `FileHandler` from the logging configuration. The script now only uses a
  `StreamHandler` for console output.

## Recent Changes

- Modified logging setup in `xkcd_scraper.py` on 7/1/2025 to avoid writing logs to a file, ensuring cleaner project
  directory structure as per user request.

## Next Steps

- Monitor if the user requires further adjustments to the logging behavior or additional features for the XKCD scraper.
- Continue to update memory bank files with any new tasks or changes to maintain project documentation.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Decision to retain console logging for debugging purposes while disabling file logging to meet user preference for
  avoiding log file creation.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- User preference for minimal file creation outside of essential project outputs (e.g., comic images).

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Simple configuration changes in logging can significantly align the tool with user needs regarding project
  cleanliness.
