# Active Context

## Current Focus

- **XKCD Scraper Script**: The current focus is on a Python script designed to fetch the latest XKCD comic every 24
  hours and save it as `latest_xkcd.jpg` in the `xkcd_scraper/comics` directory. The script has been updated to ensure
  smooth execution and proper file handling.
- **README.md Integration**: The latest XKCD comic is displayed at the bottom of the main `README.md` file with a
  humorous caption to enhance user engagement.

## Recent Changes

- **Script Update**: Modified `xkcd_scraper.py` to overwrite the comic file with a static filename (`latest_xkcd.jpg`)
  and added logic to exit gracefully after fetching.
- **Documentation**: Updated `xkcd_scraper/README.md` with revised usage instructions and added a funny description in
  the main `README.md` under the "Latest XKCD Comic" section.
- **Memory Bank Update**: Documenting the recent work to ensure continuity and knowledge persistence.

## Next Steps

- **Automation**: Set up a scheduled task or cron job to run the XKCD scraper script automatically every 24 hours.
- **Enhancements**: Add error notifications or logging to alert users if the comic fetch fails.
- **User Feedback**: Incorporate any further feedback or requests for additional features related to the XKCD comic
  display or script functionality.
