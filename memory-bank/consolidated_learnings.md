# Consolidated Learnings

This file contains curated, summarized, and actionable insights derived from the raw reflection log. It serves as the primary, refined knowledge base for long-term use.

## Memory Bank Reflection Protocol

- Maintain two key files for knowledge management:
  - `raw_reflection_log.md` for detailed, timestamped task reflections.
  - `consolidated_learnings.md` for distilled, actionable knowledge.
- Before task completion, review and analyze the task to identify learnings, difficulties, and successes.
- Log detailed reflections in `raw_reflection_log.md` with clear task references and dates.
- Periodically consolidate raw reflections into this file, organizing insights by topic and ensuring clarity and actionability.
- Prune the raw reflection log to keep it focused on recent, unprocessed reflections.
- This process supports continuous improvement, knowledge retention, and avoids redundant effort.

## Best Practices for Reflection Logging

- Capture new information, techniques, patterns, and project-specific commands.
- Document challenges and resolutions as learning opportunities.
- Highlight successful strategies and key contributing factors.
- Keep entries concise, clear, and actionable.
- Organize content logically for easy retrieval and future reference.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- Establish templates and guidelines for consistent raw reflection logging.
- Automate or standardize the consolidation and pruning process.
- Educate all contributors on the importance and use of these files.
- Regularly review and update the consolidated learnings to reflect evolving project knowledge.

## EditorConfig and Prettier Integration

- When using an `.editorconfig` file, always pair it with a `.prettierrc` configuration to avoid formatting conflicts.
- Recommended `.prettierrc` structure for projects using EditorConfig:
  ```json
  {
    "editorconfig": true,
    "trailingComma": "all",
    "printWidth": 80,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "semi": false
  }
  ```
- This pairing ensures consistent formatting behavior and prevents conflicts between EditorConfig and Prettier settings.
