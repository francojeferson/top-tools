# Progress for Top Tools Project

## Current Status

The Top Tools project is actively being developed with a focus on curating and documenting essential development tools,
browser extensions, and VSCode configurations to enhance developer productivity. The memory bank files have been
reviewed and updated as needed to reflect the current state and objectives of the project.

## Completed Tasks

- **Initial Setup**: Project repository established at `c:/Users/DELLI7/repos/top-tools` with core directories for
  memory bank and source files.
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core memory bank files created, including `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`,
  `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- **Tool Documentation**: Initial documentation for VSCode settings, browser extensions, and other tools added in the
  `src/` directory.
- **Memory Bank Review (July 4, 2025)**: Comprehensive review of all core memory bank files completed to ensure
  alignment with project goals. No immediate updates were needed for `techContext.md` as it accurately reflects the
  current technical landscape.

## Pending Tasks

- **Ongoing Tool Curation**: Continue identifying and documenting high-value tools and extensions to expand the
  repository's offerings.
- **Community Engagement**: Develop mechanisms for community feedback and contributions to enhance the project's scope
  and relevance (future milestone).
- **Documentation Updates**: Regularly update memory bank files as new tools are added or project objectives evolve.
- **Context Window Management**: Monitor context window usage during task execution to prevent context loss, adhering to
  thresholds for task handoff (40% early alert, 50% strong recommendation, 75% critical warning).

## Known Issues

- **Rapid Tool Evolution**: Tools and extensions evolve quickly, requiring frequent documentation updates to prevent
  obsolescence. This is an ongoing challenge addressed through regular reviews.
- **Platform Specificity**: Some configurations are Windows-specific due to the development environment. Future updates
  may need to address cross-platform compatibility.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Focus (June 2025)**: Project launched with a focus on developer productivity tools, emphasizing
  documentation over executable code.
- **AI Integration (June 2025)**: Decision to leverage AI tools like Cline for documentation automation and task
  management, guided by custom rules in the `src/clinerules/` directory.
- **Memory Bank Structure (June 2025)**: Established a structured set of Markdown files to preserve project context
  across sessions, ensuring continuity despite AI memory resets.
