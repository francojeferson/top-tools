# Progress for Top Tools Project

## What Works

- **Repository Structure**: The basic structure for organizing tools, browser extensions, and VSCode configurations has
  been established, providing a clear framework for categorization.
- **Core Documentation**: Initial versions of essential memory bank files ('projectbrief.md', 'productContext.md',
  'activeContext.md', 'systemPatterns.md', 'techContext.md') are in place, providing a foundation for project knowledge.
- **Browser Extension Documentation**: Updated in early June 2025 to include the latest versions and features of
  recommended extensions.
- **VSCode Extension Documentation**: Similarly updated in early June 2025 to reflect current tools and configurations
  for development environments.

## What's Left to Build

- **Automation Tools**: Develop or integrate automation scripts to periodically check for updates or changes in tool
  status, reducing manual maintenance efforts.
- **Community Feedback Mechanism**: Implement features to allow users to suggest new tools, report issues, or provide
  feedback on existing documentation.
- **AI-Assisted Documentation**: Explore and integrate AI tools to assist in generating or updating documentation
  content for tools and extensions.
- **Comprehensive Tool Validation**: Complete validation of all listed tools and extensions to ensure they are current,
  supported, and correctly categorized by lifecycle status (Active/Replaced/Deprecated).

## Current Status

- **In Progress**:
  - **Extension Validation**: Currently verifying the lifecycle status of browser and VSCode extensions to ensure only
    active and supported tools are recommended. Approximately 30% complete as of 6/26/2025, with continued focus as of
    6/29/2025 update.
  - **Documentation Enhancement**: Expanding detailed usage instructions, installation guides, and troubleshooting tips
    for each tool and extension. Progress is ongoing with a focus on high-priority tools as of 6/29/2025.
- **Completed**:
  - Repository structure setup and initial categorization of tools.
  - Core memory bank documentation established.
  - Updates to browser and VSCode extension documentation completed in early June 2025.
  - Renamed `src/installed-windows-programs.md` to `src/windows.md` and updated references in `README.md` on 6/27/2025.
  - Comprehensive update of all core Memory Bank files to reflect the latest project status on 6/29/2025.
- **Not Started**:
  - Automation for tool status updates.
  - Community feedback integration.
  - AI tool integration for documentation support.

## Known Issues

- **Incomplete Documentation**: Some tools and extensions lack detailed guides or troubleshooting information, reducing
  their utility for users.
- **Pending Validations**: A significant number of extensions have not yet been validated for their current lifecycle
  status, which may lead to outdated recommendations.
- **Lack of Automation**: Manual updates to tool status and documentation are time-consuming and prone to oversight,
  necessitating automation solutions.
- **Memory Bank Sync**: Regular updates to the Memory Bank are critical to ensure continuity and accuracy of project
  context, addressed with the update on 6/29/2025.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup (Pre-2025)**: Focused on creating a basic repository structure and listing well-known tools and
  extensions without detailed lifecycle management.
- **Early 2025 Shift**: Recognized the need for detailed documentation and lifecycle tracking, leading to updates in
  browser and VSCode extension docs in early June 2025.
- **Mid-2025 Adjustment (6/26/2025)**: Prioritized extension validation and documentation enhancement following user
  feedback and memory bank review. Decision to explore automation and community features to improve maintenance and user
  engagement.
- **Future Direction**: Plan to integrate AI tools for documentation assistance and establish a community feedback loop
  to ensure the repository remains relevant and user-focused.
