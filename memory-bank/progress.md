# Progress

## What Works

- **XKCD Scraper Script**: The Python script successfully fetches the latest XKCD comic and saves it as
  `latest_xkcd.jpg` in the `xkcd_scraper/comics` directory. It handles file overwriting and exits gracefully after
  completion.
- **README.md Integration**: The latest XKCD comic is displayed at the bottom of the main `README.md` file with a
  concise and humorous caption: "Get ready for a geeky giggleâ€”XKCD might just crash your code with laughter!"
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation has been added in `xkcd_scraper/README.md`, detailing setup, usage, and
  manual execution of the script.

## What's Left to Build

- **Automation Setup**: Implement a scheduled task or cron job to run the XKCD scraper script automatically every 24
  hours.
- **Error Handling Enhancements**: Add notifications or detailed logging to alert users if the comic fetch fails due to
  network issues or other errors.
- **Additional Features**: Include features like fetching comic metadata (title, alt text) to display alongside the
  image in `README.md`.

## Current Status

- The XKCD scraper project is functional and meets the core requirement of fetching and displaying the latest comic.
  Recent updates focused on script reliability, documentation, and user engagement through humor in the display caption.
- The project is in an active state, with ongoing documentation in the memory bank to ensure knowledge persistence and
  guide future enhancements.

## Known Issues

- **Automation Missing**: Currently, the script requires manual execution or external scheduling to run every 24 hours.
- **Error Notification**: Lack of user alerts or logs for failed fetches, which could leave users unaware of issues.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup (Date: 7/1/2025)**: Created the basic XKCD scraper script to fetch the latest comic and save it with a
  static filename.
- **Documentation Update (Date: 7/1/2025)**: Added detailed usage instructions in `xkcd_scraper/README.md` and
  integrated the comic display into the main `README.md`.
- **User Engagement (Date: 7/1/2025)**: Iteratively refined the comic description in `README.md` to be more concise and
  humorous based on user feedback.
- **Memory Bank Update (Date: 7/1/2025)**: Documented the project status, recent changes, and next steps in the memory
  bank files to maintain project continuity.
