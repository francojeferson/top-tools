# Progress for XKCD Scraper Project

## What Works

- **XKCD Comic Fetching**: The script successfully fetches and saves the latest XKCD comic as "latest_xkcd.jpg" in the
  "comics" directory.
- **Logging Configuration**: Updated the logging setup in `xkcd_scraper.py` to prevent the creation of
  "xkcd_scraper.log". Logging now outputs only to the console via `StreamHandler`, ensuring a cleaner project directory.

## What's Left to Build

- Potential enhancements or additional features for the XKCD scraper, such as scheduling periodic comic fetches or
  handling multiple comics, if requested by the user.
- Any user-specific requirements for logging or output formatting that may arise in future tasks.

## Current Status

- The XKCD Scraper project is functional with the core feature of fetching the latest comic implemented.
- Recent update on 7/1/2025 addressed user request to avoid creating log files, aligning the project with preferences
  for minimal file output.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this time. The script operates as expected with the updated logging configuration.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial implementation included file-based logging to "xkcd_scraper.log" for tracking script execution and errors.
- Decision made on 7/1/2025 to modify logging to console-only output to meet user requirement of avoiding log file
  creation, maintaining visibility of script operations through terminal output.
