# Raw Reflection Log

## Entry: XKCD Scraper Script Development

- **Date**: 2025-07-01
- **TaskRef** - "Create a script to scrape XKCD latest cartoon every 24 hours"

### Learnings

- Discovered that using a static filename (`latest_xkcd.jpg`) for the XKCD comic simplifies integration into
  documentation like `README.md`, avoiding the need for dynamic file path updates.
- Confirmed that proper file handling (checking for existing files and overwriting) in Python scripts prevents
  accumulation of unnecessary files and ensures the latest comic is always displayed.
- Project-specific command for running the script: `cd xkcd_scraper && python xkcd_scraper.py`.
- Adding humor to documentation can enhance user engagement, as seen with the iterative refinement of the comic
  description in `README.md`.

### Difficulties

- Initial challenge in making the description concise and funny, requiring multiple iterations based on user feedback.
  Resolved by focusing on a punchy, geeky humor style that aligns with XKCD's tone.

### Successes

- The script update to use a static filename and exit gracefully after fetching was effective, ensuring reliability.
- Integration of the comic image into `README.md` with a humorous caption was well-received after refinement, improving
  the visual appeal and engagement of the documentation.

### Improvements Identified for Consolidation

- General pattern: Use static filenames for regularly updated assets to simplify integration into static documentation.
- Project-specific: XKCD scraper script command and the importance of user feedback in refining user-facing content like
  captions.
