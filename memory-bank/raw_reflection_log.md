<task>Update src/vscode.md to clarify EditorConfig and Prettier usage</task>

Learnings:

- Clarified that when using an .editorconfig file, it must be used together with a .prettierrc file to avoid formatting conflicts.
- Provided a recommended .prettierrc structure including "editorconfig": true, trailing commas, print width, single quotes, and no semicolons.
- Added this guidance in the Best Practices section of src/vscode.md for clear visibility.

Difficulties:

- None encountered; straightforward content addition.

Successes:

- Successfully integrated the note in a logical section without disrupting existing content.
- Ensured formatting consistency and clarity in the added JSON example.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- Best practice to always pair EditorConfig with Prettier configuration to prevent formatting conflicts.
- Recommended Prettier config structure for projects using EditorConfig.
