## Entry: 2025-07-02 - TaskRef: "Update Memory Bank with Project Focus"

**Date**: 2025-07-02  
**TaskRef**: "Update Memory Bank with Project Focus"

**Learnings**:

- Clarified project focus: Top Tools is the primary project, with XKCD Scraper as a humorous add-on, aligning
  documentation accordingly.
- High context window usage (previously at 68%, currently at 84%) necessitates proactive task handoff proposals to
  manage context effectively.
- User preference to continue in the current session despite high context window usage, highlighting the importance of
  warning about potential context loss.

**Difficulties**:

- Balancing context window management with user preference to continue in the current session, requiring clear
  communication of risks.

**Successes**:

- Successfully updated `progress.md` and `activeContext.md` to reflect the correct project focus, ensuring consistency
  in documentation.
- Effective adherence to memory bank update protocols as per user request.

**Improvements Identified for Consolidation**:

- General pattern: Importance of clear project focus in documentation to avoid misalignments.
- General pattern: Proactive context window management strategies, including task handoff proposals.
- Top Tools Project: Documentation updated to prioritize Top Tools, with XKCD Scraper as secondary.
