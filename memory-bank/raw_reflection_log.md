Date: 2025-07-09 TaskRef: "Memory Bank Maintenance Cycle 2025-07-09"

Learnings:

- Discovered importance of regular memory bank audits for context preservation
- Confirmed auto-formatting behavior in VSCode affects SEARCH/REPLACE operations
- Established pattern for cross-file synchronization (progress.md ↔ activeContext.md)

Difficulties:

- Required multiple file reads to establish chronological consistency
- Needed to reconcile timestamps across different documentation files

Successes:

- Maintained Baby Steps™ methodology through sequential file updates
- Successfully implemented continuous improvement protocol requirements
- Achieved full documentation alignment across memory bank files

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Memory bank maintenance checklist (file update sequence, verification steps)
- Technical insight: Auto-formatter awareness in SEARCH/REPLACE operations
