TaskRef: 'Add Postman as Active extension in src/vscode.md'

Learnings:
  - Learned that precise replace_in_file operations on large markdown tables can fail due to exact match requirements
    and auto-formatting differences.
  - Using write_to_file to overwrite the entire file is a reliable fallback for large or complex edits.
  - Postman extension is appropriately categorized as Active with medium performance impact for API development and
    testing in VSCode extension documentation.
  - Auto-formatting by user's editor can affect spacing and alignment in markdown tables, which must be accounted for in
    future edits.

Difficulties:
  - Multiple failed attempts to insert a new row in the markdown table using replace_in_file due to exact content
    mismatch.
  - Need to carefully consider editor auto-formatting effects on file content when planning targeted edits.

Successes:
  - Successfully updated src/vscode.md with Postman extension included.
  - Maintained alphabetical order and consistent formatting in the summary table.
  - Followed custom instructions and user requirements precisely.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - Strategy for editing markdown tables in source files:
      prefer write_to_file for large or complex tables to avoid partial match errors.
  - Awareness of editor auto-formatting effects on markdown content and implications for replace_in_file tool usage.
