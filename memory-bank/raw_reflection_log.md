Date: 2025-08-02 TaskRef: "Refocus memory bank to track src directory changes"

Learnings:

- The memory bank should primarily track changes in the src directory (tool documentation) rather than internal
  maintenance activities
- Project documentation needs to clearly distinguish between tool curation progress and memory bank maintenance

Difficulties:

- Initial focus was too internal on the memory bank system itself
- Needed to refocus documentation to better represent actual project progress

Successes:

- Successfully updated all memory bank files to better reflect src directory changes
- Improved clarity in progress tracking between tool documentation and system maintenance

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Memory bank should primarily track project artifacts (src directory) rather than its own maintenance
- Documentation principle: Clearly separate project progress from system maintenance activities
