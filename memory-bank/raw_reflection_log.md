TaskRef: 'Create a new clinerule for automating cline-metrics on new projects'

Learnings:
  - Understood the process of creating a new `.clinerule` file following the guidelines in
    `clinerules-best-practices.md`.
  - Recognized the value of automating `cline-metrics` analysis for new projects to provide continuous insights into
    development value, code quality, and financial ROI.
  - Learned to structure rules with clear triggers, processes, and user notifications to ensure seamless integration
    into project workflows.

Difficulties:
  - Encountered an initial challenge in locating the correct path for Cline session data during the earlier task of
    running `cline-metrics`, which required user input to resolve. This highlighted the importance of handling path
    detection flexibly in automation rules.

Successes:
  - Successfully created and saved the `cline-metrics-automation.md` rule file in `src/clinerules`, which automates the
    execution of `cline-metrics` for new projects.
  - Ensured the rule aligns with the user's request by including detailed steps for prerequisite checks, script
    availability, path detection, and result reporting.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
  - General pattern:
      Automation of analysis tools like `cline-metrics` can significantly enhance project tracking and decision-making.
  - Specific to this rule:
      Include mechanisms for user customization of analysis frequency or opting out of automated runs to balance
      automation with user control.
