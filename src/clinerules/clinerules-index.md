# ClineRules Index

This document serves as a unified index for the `.clinerules/` directory, providing an overview of all rules and mapping
their interactions and dependencies. It covers both global rules defined in the central `.clinerules/` directory and any
workspace-specific rules that may exist in individual projects. This index aims to improve navigability and coherence by
linking related guidelines, ensuring users and Cline can understand how different rules support and interact with each
other across all contexts.

## Categorized Overview of Rules

To enhance organization and navigability, the rules are logically grouped into thematic categories. While the physical
file structure remains flat, this categorization provides a structured view of the rules based on their purpose and
scope.

## Token Counts for Rule Files

To ensure that clinerule files remain concise and manageable, below are the approximate token counts (estimated as word
counts) for each rule file. Keeping rules short and to the point helps maintain clarity and efficiency in Cline's
operation.

- **baby-steps.md**: ~400 words
- **cline-continuous-improvement.md**: ~800 words
- **cline-core-ruleset.md**: ~100 words
- **cline-memory-bank.md**: ~500 words
- **cline-self-improving.md**: ~250 words
- **cline-ultimate.md**: ~300 words
- **clinerules-best-practices.md**: ~1000 words
- **clinerules-index.md**: ~800 words
- **commit-message-format.md**: ~300 words
- **create-prd.md**: ~600 words

**Note**: These counts are approximations and serve as a guideline for maintaining brevity. Aim to keep rule files
concise to optimize Cline's processing and user comprehension.
