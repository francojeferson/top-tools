# Git Configuration Guide

_Last updated: 2025-06-03_

## Reference Configuration Files

The following configuration files are located in the `src/gitconfig/` directory and are referenced throughout this guide:

- `.bashrc`: Contains shell environment settings and Git aliases.
- `.bash_profile`: Loads `.bashrc` and sets up the shell environment.
- `.gitconfig`: Stores user-specific Git configuration settings.

## Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code, collaborate with others, and manage project history efficiently.

## Installing Git on Windows
1. Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/) to download the Git installer for Windows.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. During installation, ensure that the option to add Git to your system PATH is selected.
4. Optionally, install Git Bash for a Unix-like terminal experience on Windows.

## Configuring Git
Git configuration is managed through several files, including `.gitconfig`, `.bashrc`, and `.bash_profile`.

### .gitconfig
This file stores user-specific Git configurations. Below are some common settings:

```ini
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = your.email@example.com

[alias]
    st = status
    co = checkout
    ci = commit
    br = branch
    lg = log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

### .bashrc
This file is used to set up the shell environment and Git aliases. Example content:

```bash
# Git aliases
alias gs='git status -sb'
alias gcc='git checkout'
alias gcm='git checkout master'
alias gaa='git add --all'
alias gc='git commit -m $2'
alias push='git push'
alias gpo='git push origin'
alias pull='git pull'
alias clone='git clone'
alias stash='git stash'
alias pop='git stash pop'
alias ga='git add'
alias gb='git branch'
alias gl="git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"
alias gm='git merge'
```

### .bash_profile
This file is used to load `.bashrc` and set up the environment:

```bash
# generated by Git for Windows
test -f ~/.profile && . ~/.profile
test -f ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc
```

## Common Git Commands and Aliases
- `git status`: Check the status of your repository.
- `git commit`: Commit changes to the repository.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Pull changes from a remote repository.
- `git branch`: List, create, or delete branches.

## Creating and Configuring an SSH Key

SSH keys are used to securely connect to remote repositories. Here's how to create and configure an SSH key:

1. **Generate an SSH Key**:
   - **Recommended**: Use ED25519 for better security and performance.
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - **Alternative**: Use RSA if compatibility with older systems is needed.
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```

2. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:
   - Start the SSH agent in the background:
     ```bash
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
     ```
   - Add your SSH private key to the SSH agent:
     ```bash
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     ```

3. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**:
   - Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to GitHub, navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**, and click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste your key and save.

## Using Git Aliases

Git aliases simplify command usage. Here are some examples from the `.bashrc` file:

- `gs`: `git status -sb`
- `gcc`: `git checkout`
- `gcm`: `git checkout master`
- `gaa`: `git add --all`
- `gc`: `git commit -m $2`

To use an alias, simply type it in the terminal. For example, use `gs` to quickly check the status of your repository.

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

### SSH Authentication Errors
- **Issue**: SSH authentication fails.
- **Solution**: Ensure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent and associated with your GitHub account.

### Alias Conflicts
- **Issue**: An alias doesn't work as expected.
- **Solution**: Check the `.bashrc` file for correct alias definitions and ensure there are no conflicting aliases.

- Regularly update Git and your configuration files.
- Use meaningful commit messages and maintain a clean commit history.
- Leverage Git aliases to streamline your workflow.
