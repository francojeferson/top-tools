The termcanonwas originally devised to refer to the books of the Bible which are generally accepted as being actually part of the Bible, instead ofapocrypha, Christian works that, while edifying and perhaps ancient, aren't considered part of the Bible. It subsequently was adapted to refer to theSherlock Holmesstories which were written byArthur Conan Doyle, as opposed to the adaptations into other formats (stage plays, films, etc.) and non-Doyle stories. An early example of this connection was in a 1910 satirical essay by the Catholic scholar Ronald A. Knox,Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes.

From there, it took on its modern, even broader meaning for fiction in general: the material widely accepted as created by the recognized author(s). For instance,Star Warscanon comprises the films and some TV shows made byLucasfilm(andDisneyafter its buyout of Lucasfilm), but that canon is supplemented by a large amount of non-canonicalStar Warscontent in other mediasuch as books, video games, comic books, fan fiction, etc. In addition, what is canon can be changed, as occurred when a large portion of formerly canon Star Wars content was [decanonised] in 2014 to make narrative space for the upcoming Star Wars trilogy sequel movies.

Determining what is canon and what is not in a narrative framework has a tendency to excite huge passions amongst fans, similar to the huge factionalisation of religions where they decide what is and what is binding to the fandom.

Here, Cueball is using the modern meaning to describe a theological dispute from the 18th century whencanonhad only its original, Biblical meaning. There are many examples of fierce theological disputes that were recorded in pamphlets and books throughout the 16th to 19th century, for example just regarding the correct mode of baptism:1644 (683 pages),1646 (342 pages),1697 (150 pages),1768 (219 pages),1831 (400 pages),1874 (107 pages)- examples selected from hundreds of similar books.

Similarly the word "fandom" comes from the word "fan" (+ '-dom', as in a class of people), which is the shorter form of "fanatic". Fanatic's etymology, in turn, points to the latin word "fanaticus" meaning 'of a temple, inspired by a god'. (The latin word "fanum" means 'temple'.)

AnAchillesâ€™ heelis the weak point of something or someone who is otherwise very strong. It derives from the legend of the great Greek warriorAchilles, who as a baby was dipped into the riverStyxbyhis motherto make him invulnerable everywhere on his body that the water touched. However, during the dipping, his mother held him by the heel, which was thus vulnerable because it didn't enter the river, and in fact Achilles later died after he was shot in that heel with an arrow. The joke again is the self-reference.
