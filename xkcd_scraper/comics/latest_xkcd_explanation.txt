In this comicCueballis wondering aloud what happened to an island, possibly asandbarthat was visible earlier, but is not anymore.Meganexplains to him that thetidehas gone up, and thus the island is underwater. She then tells him about what causes tides, namely theMoon, which is large enough and orbits close enough to Earth to gravitationally affect the waters of our oceans, causing them to go up and down daily. Similarly to2809: Moon, Cueball is amazed at the oddity of our planet having a natural satellite large enough to affect our oceans, and Randall seems to be as well, as the caption says that if the Moon didn't exist, it would sound extremely outlandish and sci-fi-like.

Tideson Earth would indeed seem strange and unusual to a visitor from almost anywhere else in the universe, along with other features such as the large expanses of liquid water and the oxygen-rich atmosphere that was created by biological activity (photosynthesis). Not to mention the biological activity. As stated in the comic, tides on Earth are largely the result of a single large moon (theMoon) orbiting the Earth at a relatively short distance. This configuration isunique within our solar system: Mercury and Venus have no moons, Mars (smaller than Earth) has two (far, far smaller) moons, and each of the remaining planets have several, but are comparatively insignificant, individually. There are four moons in the solar system bigger than the Moon, and a few more almost as big, but they all orbit gaseous planets much larger than Earth, amongst many other minor moons, and thus have far less practical tidal influence upon their respective parent planets. Thetwelfthlargest known moon is Charon, 12.2% the mass of the dwarf planet Pluto, that it it orbits. (The Moon has 1.2% the mass of Earth, by far the largest such ratio amongst the fully-fledged planetary moons, and is also about 20 times further away in comparison). Its much larger tidal effect has actually resulted in mutualtidal lockingso that Charon now orbits only above the same part of Pluto and could not create Earth-like tide cycles. Evenifthere were plutonian seas quite like ours, another required feature that is effectively unique the Earthbound scenario.

The Sun also influences Earth's tide, as might be expected. If the Moon were absent from Earth orbit, however, tidal amplitudes would be about a third. The Sun's gravity has about half the influence on Earth's liquid water masses than the Moon does, as the relative distances involved mean that the solar gravity gradient across different parts of the Earth and its oceans is far less. Also, if more than one moon were present, the moon(s) present had much less massorthe moon(s) present had more distant orbits, tides would have less amplitude. And, in the case of there being multiple moons, would have much more complex (and possibly difficult to predict) periodicity.

The overall effect of the Moon-dominated tides is that in marginally more than every 6.2 hours (at least for an ocean-dominated equatorial island, such as the comic appears to depict) something that was originally fully revealed by a retreating tide could now be covered be the next rising one. This effect is even more pronounced every 14.75 days, as the Moon and Sun act together to create even higher high tides and lower low tides. Anyone used to the behaviour of the sea would probably be unsurprised by this, but someone normally resident more inland can quite easily be caught out, potentially arriving somewhere by the coast in the morning, to witness the sight of particularly low water levels, then by noon/early-afternoon finding that the seascape has changed and high-water has been reached.

The title text mentions other elements of life on Earth, saying they also seem as outlandish as tides, includingcoral islands, islands that build up from the skeletons or secretions of small animals,lightning, when electrical discharge creates bright light in the atmosphere, and themetamorphosisofbutterflies, when caterpillars create a chrysalis and come out as butterflies.

Lightning is an element of life on Earth since it is thought to have produced chemicals which were important to life's origins.  Ozone, produced by lightning, reduces the ultra-violet light reaching earths surface.  This protection may have made it easier for life to transition out of the water.  Microscopic life in the atmosphere (the aerobiome) affects cloud formation and weather, for instance, some bacteria promote the formation of ice crystals which contributes to rain.  As such, the aerobiome may also affect lightning.  Lightning is probably a common planetary phenomenon; within our solar system, itoccurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and probably Uranus and Neptune.  On Mars, lightning probably is generated by electric discharge in dust clouds.  The evidence about possible lightning on Venus is mixed.
