# Wisdom Extracted from XKCD Comic Explanation

## SUMMARY

Randall Munroe explains Earth's unique tides caused by our Moon, comparing them to seemingly outlandish natural
phenomena.

## IDEAS

- Earth's tides are primarily caused by the Moon's gravitational pull
- Our Moon is unusually large compared to other planets in our solar system
- Earth's tidal configuration is unique within our solar system
- The Moon causes Earth's ocean waters to rise and fall approximately twice daily
- Tidal cycles occur in more than 6.2 hour intervals for ocean islands
- Every 14.75 days, the Moon and Sun create higher high tides and lower low tides
- The Sun influences Earth's tides but with less impact than the Moon
- Without our Moon, tidal amplitudes would be about one-third of current levels
- Other planets have moons, but none with such significant tidal effects on their planets
- Charon, Pluto's largest moon, is tidal-locked with its planet unlike Earth and Moon
- Earth's Moon has 1.2% of Earth's mass, the largest ratio of any full planetary moon
- Coral islands form from skeletons or secretions of small marine animals
- Lightning creates bright atmospheric electrical discharges
- Butterflies undergo metamorphosis from caterpillars to winged adults
- Lightning may have produced chemicals important for life's origins on Earth
- Ozone from lightning reduces harmful UV radiation reaching Earth's surface
- The aerobiome contains microscopic life that affects cloud formation and weather
- Lightning occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and possibly Uranus and Neptune
- Lightning on Mars may form from electrical discharge in dust clouds
- Coral islands, lightning, and metamorphosis seem as outlandish as tides

## INSIGHTS

- Earth's cosmic uniqueness makes familiar phenomena seem extraordinary to outsiders
- Natural satellite size relative to its planet determines tidal influence magnitude
- Solar system configurations create varied planetary tidal behaviors
- Biological activity interacts with astronomical phenomena in complex ways
- Atmospheric lightning may have facilitated life's transition from water to land
- Microscopic atmospheric ecosystems influence larger weather patterns
- Planetary characteristics that seem normal to us are often rare in the universe
- Scientific understanding reveals the extraordinary nature of ordinary experiences

## QUOTES

- "Cueball is wondering aloud what happened to an island, possibly as a sandbar that was visible earlier, but is not
  anymore" - Explanation
- "Megan explains to him that the tide has gone up, and thus the island is underwater" - Explanation
- "She then tells him about what causes tides, namely the Moon, which is large enough and orbits close enough to Earth
  to gravitationally affect the waters of our oceans" - Explanation
- "Cueball is amazed at the oddity of our planet having a natural satellite large enough to affect our oceans" -
  Explanation
- "if the Moon didn't exist, it would sound extremely outlandish and sci-fi-like" - Explanation
- "Tides on Earth would indeed seem strange and unusual to a visitor from almost anywhere else in the universe" -
  Explanation
- "tides on Earth are largely the result of a single large moon (the Moon) orbiting the Earth at a relatively short
  distance" - Explanation
- "This configuration is unique within our solar system" - Explanation
- "Its much larger tidal effect has actually resulted in mutual tidal locking so that Charon now orbits only above the
  same part of Pluto" - Explanation
- "The Sun's gravity has about half the influence on Earth's liquid water masses than the Moon does" - Explanation
- "something that was originally fully revealed by a retreating tide could now be covered be the next rising one" -
  Explanation
- "this effect is even more pronounced every 14.75 days, as the Moon and Sun act together to create even higher high
  tides and lower low tides" - Explanation
- "The title text mentions other elements of life on Earth, saying they also seem as outlandish as tides" - Explanation
- "coral islands, islands that build up from the skeletons or secretions of small animals" - Explanation
- "lightning, when electrical discharge creates bright light in the atmosphere" - Explanation
- "the metamorphosis of butterflies, when caterpillars create a chrysalis and come out as butterflies" - Explanation

## FACTS

- Earth's tides are primarily caused by the Moon's gravitational pull on oceans
- The Moon causes ocean waters to rise and fall approximately every 6.2 hours
- The Sun contributes about half the Moon's gravitational effect on Earth's tides
- The Moon contains 1.2% of Earth's mass, the largest ratio of any planetary moon
- Earth's Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system by diameter
- Mercury and Venus have no moons, while Mars has two small ones
- Charon, Pluto's largest moon, is 12.2% the mass of its parent planet
- Earth's Moon is about 20 times further from Earth than Charon is from Pluto
- Tidal locking between Earth and Moon means the Moon always shows the same face
- Higher high tides occur every 14.75 days when Moon and Sun align
- Coral islands form from accumulated calcium carbonate secretions of marine life
- Lightning produces ozone which reduces UV radiation reaching Earth's surface
- The aerobiome contains atmospheric bacteria that facilitate ice crystal formation
- Lightning occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and possibly Neptune and Uranus
- Martian lightning likely forms from electrical discharge in dust clouds
- Evidence about lightning on Venus remains inconclusive
