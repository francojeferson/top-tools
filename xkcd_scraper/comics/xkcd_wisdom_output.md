# Wisdom Extracted from XKCD Comic 3109 Explanation

## SUMMARY

Randall Munroe mocks internet-connected appliances like dehumidifiers, questioning their necessity and security risks in
XKCD 3109.

## IDEAS

- Internet-connected appliances often seem like over-engineering for minimal real benefit to users.
- Dehumidifiers don't obviously need internet updates without significant hardware changes being involved.
- Cueball's sarcasm highlights the absurdity of needing updates for simple devices like dehumidifiers.
- Many smart devices are marketed as advanced despite offering little practical added value.
- Connectivity in appliances can sometimes be more about marketing than functional improvement.
- Remote access to dehumidifier data could be useful for monitoring water levels.
- Knowing humidity logs over time via internet could indicate dehumidifier performance issues.
- Internet connectivity might help alert users when dehumidifier tanks need emptying soon.
- WiFi connection allows local data sharing without needing full internet server access.
- However, many devices require internet apps, risking functionality if servers shut down.
- Manufacturer servers for smart devices can become obsolete, rendering devices partially useless.
- Security patches for internet-connected devices often require the internet, creating ironic vulnerabilities.
- Removing internet connectivity could prevent the need for remote exploit patches entirely.
- The updater itself might be the primary source of remote security vulnerabilities.
- Acoustic or light-based attacks on devices are possible, though rare and complex.
- Patching could theoretically mitigate unconventional attacks like acoustic hacking from outside homes.
- Previous XKCD comics have also critiqued unnecessary smart features in everyday appliances.
- Comic 3044 humorously reviewed a humidifier, paralleling current dehumidifier connectivity critique.
- Comic 463 highlighted security issues in voting machines, akin to appliance vulnerabilities.
- Comic 1966 explored smart home security risks, relevant to current dehumidifier concerns.
- Comic 1912 on thermostats warned of risks in computerizing simple household devices.
- Over-engineering solutions often stem from a 'because we can' mentality in tech.
- Internet connectivity in appliances can create more problems than it actually solves.
- The trend of smart appliances may prioritize perceived innovation over practical utility.
- Security concerns with smart devices often outweigh the minor conveniences they provide.

## INSIGHTS

- The irony of needing internet to patch internet-caused vulnerabilities is striking.
- Smart device obsolescence due to server shutdowns poses significant user risks.
- Unconventional attack vectors like acoustic hacking highlight broader smart device insecurities.
- Historical XKCD critiques show a consistent skepticism toward unnecessary smart features.
- Practical remote monitoring is possible without full internet dependency in appliances.
- Consumer desire for 'advanced' tech often drives impractical smart device features.
- Security patches for smart appliances can become a self-perpetuating vulnerability cycle.
- Simplicity in device design often trumps complex, internet-dependent supposed innovations.

## QUOTES

- "Randall mocks the recent trend of various appliances, such as stoves and juicers, being connected to the internet
  even though they don't require an internet connection to function." - Randall Munroe
- "A dehumidifier removes moisture from the air." - Explanation Text
- "There are no obvious ways to improve dehumidifier operation without changes to its hardware, so it's unclear what
  benefit being able to receive updates via the internet would confer." - Explanation Text
- "Cueball's sarcastic reply underlines the unlikeliness of a situation occurring where an update would be necessary." -
  Explanation Text
- "The implication is that many of these internet-connected devices are examples of over-engineering a solution to do
  things 'because we can' or because it makes it sound advanced and therefore more desirable to the customer, rather
  than because it offers any real added value." - Explanation Text
- "Dehumidifiers can provide information which would be useful to access remotely." - Explanation Text
- "For instance, it might be helpful to know the level of water in the storage tank (which must be emptied when full),
  the percent of time the humidifier is paused for deicing, a log of the humidity level over time, and whether the
  humidity exceeds a certain limit (which could indicate dehumidifier malfunction, or that the dehumidifier is
  inadequate to the conditions)." - Explanation Text
- "A local wireless network connected via WiFi is a reasonable way to send this information to a user or to other local
  devices." - Explanation Text
- "However, many devices like this now offer, or even require, connections to a special app or to the internet." -
  Explanation Text
- "They typically connect to servers run by the device's manufacturer." - Explanation Text
- "When that server goes away, the devices may stop working." - Explanation Text
- "The title text says that authorized internet access is required to patch remote exploits (i.e., harmful unauthorized
  access from the internet)." - Explanation Text
- "If this is the only use case that requires internet access, it would be much simpler to remove the attack vector for
  remote exploits by not having it connected to the internet in the first place." - Explanation Text
- "The most likely source of remote access would probably be the remote updater itself." - Explanation Text
- "However, there is proof-of-concept of devices being hacked through acoustic-based or light-based attacks (possibly
  through hacked speakers or even from outside the house), and a patch could possibly circumvent those attacks." -
  Explanation Text
- "A related device was previously referred to in 3044: Humidifier Review, and the issue of possibly considering online
  protection of devices that (arguably) should not be so easily exploitable was looked at in 463: Voting Machines and
  1966: Smart Home Security." - Explanation Text
- "Comic 1912: Thermostat also deals with risks of adding computers to appliances." - Explanation Text
- "This explanation is incomplete: This page was created WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS. Don't remove this notice too soon. If
  you can fix this issue, edit the page!" - Explanation Text
- "In this comic, Randall mocks the recent trend of various appliances, such as stoves and juicers, being connected to
  the internet even though they don't require an internet connection to function." - Randall Munroe
- "Cueball's sarcastic reply underlines the unlikeliness of a situation occurring where an update would be necessary." -
